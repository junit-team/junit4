<p>JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance
of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

<h2>
<a NAME="Summary of"></a>Summary of Changes in version 4.4beta1</h2>
<p>
Our goal is for JUnit to continue to be an excellent tool for capturing developers'
intentions about how their code should work, and quickly making sure their code 
matches those intentions.  Over the last year, we've been talking about what things 
developers would like to say about their code that have been difficult in the past, 
and how we can make them easier.  

<ul>
<li><b>assertThat</b>:

Two years ago, Joe Walnes built a new assertion mechanism on top of what was 
then JMock 1 (http://joe.truemesh.com/blog//000511.html).  
The keyword was assertThat, and the syntax looked like this:

<pre>
assertThat(x, is(3));
assertThat(x, is(not(4)));
assertThat(responseString, anyOf(containsString("color"), containsString("colour")));
assertThat(myList, hasItem("3"));
</pre>

Joe does a great job describing the advantages of this new syntax at the link above, 
so I won't belabor them here.  We have decided to include this API directly in JUnit,
because we believe it's a more extensible and readable syntax, and because it enables
both of the below new features.

<p>
Some notes:

<ul>
<li>The old assert methods are never, ever, going away.  Developers may continue using the old assertEquals, assertTrue, and
so on.
<li>The second parameter of an assertThat statement is a <tt>Matcher</tt>.  We include the Matchers we want as static imports,
like this:
<pre>
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;
</pre>
or:
<pre>
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;
</pre>
<li>Manually importing Matcher methods can be frustrating.  Eclipse 3.3 includes the ability to define
"Favorite" classes to import static methods from, which makes it easier (Search for "Favorites" in the Preferences dialog).
We expect that support for static imports will improve in all Java IDEs in the future.
<li>To allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers, we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core,
from the Hamcrest project, authored by Joe Walnes, Neil Dunn, and the authors of JMock.  This is the first time that
third-party classes have been included in JUnit.  We don't intend to do it again any time soon, but the goals of Hamcrest were
so close to our own that it made sense.
<li>JUnit currently ships with a few matchers, defined in <tt>org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers</tt> and the package 
<tt>org.junit.matchers</tt>.  To use many, many more, consider downloading the full hamcrest package.
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>assumeThat</b>: Ideally, the developer writing a test has control of all of the forces that might cause a test to fail.
Even when this isn't immediately possible, it can often improve a design to make dependencies explicit.  For example, a test
that fails when run in a different locale than the developer intended can be fixed by explicitly passing a locale to the domain 
code.
<p>
However, sometimes this is not desirable or possible.  
It's good to be able to run a test against the code as it is currently written, or to write a test that exposes a known bug.
For these situations, JUnit now includes the ability to express "assumptions":

<pre>
@Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {
   assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is('/'));
   assertThat(new User("david").configFileName(), is("configfiles/david.cfg"));
}

@Test public void correctBehaviorWhenFilenameIsNull() {
   assumeTrue(bugFixed("13356"));  // bugFixed is not included in JUnit
   assertThat(parse(null), is(new NullDocument()));
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Summary of"></a>Summary of Changes in version 4.3.1</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: 4.3 introduced a 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=115278&aid=1684562&group_id=15278">bug</a>
that caused a NullPointerException
when comparing a null reference to a non-null reference in <tt>assertEquals</tt>.
This has been fixed.
<li>Bug fix: The binary jar for 4.3 <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=115278&aid=1686931&group_id=15278">accidentally</a> included the tests and sample code,
which are now removed for a smaller download, but, as always, available from the
full zip.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Summary of"></a>Summary of Changes with version 4.3</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in array equality.  Using <tt>assertEquals</tt> to compare array contents is now deprecated.
In the future, <tt>assertEquals</tt> will revert to its pre-4.0 meaning of comparing objects based on
Java's <tt>Object.equals</tt> semantics.  To compare array contents, use the new, more reliable 
<tt>Assert.assertArrayEquals</tt> methods.
<li>The <tt>@Ignore</tt> annotation can now be applied to classes, to ignore the entire class, instead of
individual methods.
<li>Originally, developers who wanted to use a static <tt>suite()</tt> method from JUnit 3.x with a JUnit 4.x
runner had to annotate the class with <tt>@RunWith(AllTests.class)</tt>.  In the common case, this requirement
has been removed.  However, when such a class is wrapped with a JUnit4TestAdapter (which we believe is rare), the
results may not be as expected.
<li>Improved error messages for array comparison("arrays first differed at element [1][0]")
<li>Bug fix: Inaccessible base class is caught at test construction time.
<li>Bug fix: Circular suites are caught at test construction time.
<li>Bug fix: Test constructors that throw exceptions are reported correctly.
<li><b>For committers and extenders</b>
<ul>
<li>Sources now are in a separate "src" directory (this means a big break in the CVS history)
<li>Improved documentation in <tt>Request</tt>, <tt>RunWith</tt>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Summary of"></a>Summary of Changes with version 4.2</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: Inaccessible base class is caught at test construction time.
<li>Bug fix: Circular suites are caught at test construction time.
<li>Improved error messages for array comparison("arrays first differed at element [1][0]")
<li>Test constructors that throw exceptions are reported correctly.
</ul>
</p>


<h2>
<a NAME="Summary of"></a>Summary of Changes with version 4.1</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: listeners now get a correct test running time, rather than always being told 0 secs.
<li>The @RunWith annotation is now inherited by subclasses: 
all subclasses of an abstract test class will be run by the same runner.
<li>The build script fails if the JUnit unit tests fail
<li>The faq has been updated
<li>Javadoc has been improved, with more internal links, and package descriptions added (Thanks, Matthias Schmidt!)
<li>An acknowledgements.txt file has been created to credit outside contributions
<li>The <tt>Enclosed</tt> runner, which runs all of the static inner classes of a given class, has been added
to <tt>org.junit.runners</tt>.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Summary of Changes with version 4.0</h2>
<p>
The architecture of JUnit 4.0 is a substantial departure from that of earlier releases. 
Instead of 
tagging test classes by subclassing junit.framework.TestCase and tagging test methods by 
starting their name with "test", you now tag test methods with the @Test annotation.
</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
Below are the installation steps for installing JUnit:
<ol>
<li>
unzip the junit4.3.1.zip file</li>

<li>
add<i> </i><b>junit-4.3.1.jar</b> to the CLASSPATH. For example: 
<tt> set classpath=%classpath%;INSTALL_DIR\junit-4.2.jar;INSTALL_DIR</tt></li>

<li>
test the installation by running <tt>java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore org.junit.tests.AllTests.</tt></li>

<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Notice</font></b>: that the tests are not
contained in the junit-4.3.1.jar but in the installation directory directly.
Therefore make sure that the installation directory is on the class path
</ol>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Important</font></b>: don't install junit-4.3.1.jar
into the extension directory of your JDK installation. If you do so the
test class on the files system will not be found.
