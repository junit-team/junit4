Steps to build junit:

- Must be manual
  - Write release notes
  - Update version in build.xml
- Not too tedious:
  - Run the ant zip task
  - Upload stuff to github
- Tedious:
  - Update SourceForge if major release
  - Update javadocs on SourceForge and junit.org
  - Put release notes somewhere tidy, now that SourceForge isn't canonical.
  - Announce on blog, user list, dev list, twitter, junit.org
- Profit!
